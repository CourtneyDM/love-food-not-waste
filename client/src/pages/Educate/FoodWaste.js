                                <li>Roughly 1/3 of food produced in the world for human consumption every year gets wasted.  That's 1.3 billion tons!</li>
                                <li>Every year, consumers in well-developed countries waste almost as much food (222 million tons) as the entire food production of sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tons).</li>
                                <li>Even if just 1/4 of the food currently wasted were saved, it could feed 870 million hungry people.</li>

                                <li>40% of food is wasted in America every year.</li>
                                <li>That equates to 35 million tons of food.</li>
                                <li>The average American household throws away $2,200 of food each year.</li>
                                <li>The average American throws away 300lbs of food each year.</li>
                                <li>More than 20lbs of food is wasted per person every month in the United States.</li>
                                <li>20% of the food that Americans buy is never consumed.</li>
                                <li>90% of food is thrown away too soon.</li>
                                <li>Food waste has grown by 204% in America since 1960 and 50% since 1990.</li>
                                <li>Reducing food waste by just 15% would be enough to feed more than 25 million Americans every year.</li>
